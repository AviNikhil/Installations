>>>>You can use various commands in Linux to see which ports are currently in use. Here are a few commonly used commands:

1. netstat: This command displays network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, masquerade connections, and multicast memberships.
   
  
   netstat -tuln
   
   
   - `-t`: Displays TCP ports.
   - `-u`: Displays UDP ports.
   - `-l`: Shows listening ports.
   - ' -p' -Display PID/Program name for sockets. In other words, this option tells who opened   the TCP or UDP port. For example, on my system, Nginx opened TCP port 80/443, so I will /usr/sbin/nginx or its PID.
   - `-n`: Shows numerical addresses instead of resolving hostnames.

=====================================================================
2. ss : This is another utility to investigate sockets.
   
   
   ss -tuln
   

   - `-t`: Displays TCP ports.
   - `-u`: Displays UDP ports.
   - `-l`: Shows listening ports.
   - `-n`: Shows numerical addresses.

==========================================================================
3. lsof: Stands for "list open files". It can also list open network connections.
   
   ```bash
   lsof -i -P -n | grep LISTEN
   ```

   - `-i`: Selects the listing of files any of whose Internet address matches the address specified in `inet`, `dgram`, `stream`, or `unix`.
   - `-P`: Inhibits the conversion of port numbers to port names for network files. 
   - `-n`: Shows numerical addresses.
>>>>>>>>2nd syntax:

sudo lsof -i -P -n
sudo lsof -i -P -n | grep LISTEN
doas lsof -i -P -n | grep LISTEN # OpenBSD #

Consider the last line from above outputs:

sshd    85379     root    3u  IPv4 0xffff80000039e000      0t0  TCP 10.86.128.138:  22 (LISTEN)

    sshd is the name of the application.
    10.86.128.138 is the IP address to which sshd application bind to (LISTEN)
    22 is the TCP port that is being used (LISTEN)
    85379 is the process ID of the sshd process


These commands will show you which ports are currently being used and what processes are utilizing them.
